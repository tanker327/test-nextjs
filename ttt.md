8. ------
Implement the main conversion logic in the converter. Start with the basic field mappings we identified in the schema comparison. Handle the simple 1:1 field mappings first before tackling the complex transformations.

9. ------
The column_settings in input is a stringified JSON but gridState in output is also stringified JSON. Let's parse the input column_settings, transform the field names to match output format, and stringify it back for gridState.

10. ------
Add proper error handling to the converter. What happens if the input JSON is malformed, or if required fields are missing? Create appropriate error classes and validation.

11. ------
The tests are failing. Let me see the test output and debug why the conversion isn't working. Run the tests and show me the error messages so we can fix them step by step.

12. ------
Add more comprehensive test cases. Create tests for edge cases like missing fields, null values, empty arrays, and malformed JSON strings in column_settings.

13. ------
I'm getting validation errors when running the converter. Let's add better logging to see exactly which fields are failing validation and why.

14. ------
Create a test utility that can compare the converted output with expected output and highlight exactly which fields don't match, so we can debug conversion issues more easily.

15. ------
The financial data mapping is complex - input has separate fields like totalCost, forecastTotalCost, budgetTotalCost while output has nested financials.live2024, financials.outlook2024 etc. Let's implement this transformation logic.

16. ------
Some fields like 'name' vs 'title', 'ragStatus' vs 'rag' are just renamed. Create a field mapping configuration object so we can easily maintain these mappings.

17. ------
The owners field in output is an array of complex user objects, but input just has an 'owner' string. We need to handle this transformation - should we create a mock user object or look up real user data?

18. ------
Refactor the converter to use a more modular approach. Split the conversion into separate functions for different sections like user data, column settings, financial data, etc.

19. ------
Add TypeScript strict mode and fix all the type errors. Make sure we have proper typing throughout the project with no 'any' types.

20. ------
The project structure could be cleaner. Let's organize it better - create separate folders for types, converters, tests, and utilities. Update the imports accordingly.

21. ------
Add a CLI interface so users can run the converter from command line with input and output file paths. Include options for validation-only mode.

22. ------
Some field mappings might need configuration. Create a config file system so users can customize how fields are mapped without changing code.

23. ------
Add support for batch conversion - converting multiple input files at once and generating a report of successful vs failed conversions.

24. ------
The column settings transformation is brittle. Let's make it more robust by handling unknown column types and preserving data we don't recognize.

25. ------
Profile the converter performance with large input files. If it's slow, let's optimize the JSON parsing and field mapping logic.
